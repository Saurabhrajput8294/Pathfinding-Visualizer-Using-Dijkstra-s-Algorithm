# Pathfinding-Visualizer-Using-Dijkstra-s-Algorithm
This project is a visual pathfinding tool built with Python and Pygame that uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two points on a grid. The application allows users to set start and end points, place barriers, and visualize the algorithm's progress as it explores the grid and determines the optimal path.
